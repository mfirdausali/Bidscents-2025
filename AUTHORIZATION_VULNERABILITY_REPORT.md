# Critical Authorization Vulnerability Report - BidScents

## Executive Summary

Multiple critical authorization bypass vulnerabilities were discovered in the BidScents marketplace application. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to modify, delete, or create resources (products, auctions, images) on behalf of other users by manipulating the `sellerId` parameter in API requests.

**Severity: CRITICAL**  
**CVSS Score: 9.8 (Critical)**  
**Attack Vector: Network**  
**Attack Complexity: Low**  
**Privileges Required: None/Low**  
**User Interaction: None**

## Vulnerability Details

### 1. Authorization Bypass via Request Parameters

**Location**: Multiple endpoints in `server/routes.ts`

**Description**: The application accepts `sellerId` from request body or query parameters instead of using the authenticated user's ID from the JWT token. This allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of any seller.

**Affected Endpoints**:
- `PUT /api/products/:id` (lines ~2240-2242)
- `DELETE /api/products/:id` (lines ~2560-2562)
- `PUT /api/auctions/:id` (lines ~2290-2292)
- `POST /api/auctions` (lines ~2383-2385)
- `POST /api/products/:id/images` (lines ~2635-2637)
- `DELETE /api/products/:productId/images/:imageId` (lines ~2705-2707)

**Example Vulnerable Code**:
```typescript
// VULNERABLE: Accepts sellerId from client
if (req.body.sellerId) {
  sellerId = parseInt(req.body.sellerId.toString());
  // Minimal verification, but still uses client-provided ID
}
```

### 2. Insufficient Ownership Verification

Some endpoints verify that a user exists and is a seller, but still use the client-provided `sellerId` instead of the authenticated user's ID, allowing impersonation.

## Impact

1. **Product Manipulation**: Attackers can modify or delete any seller's products
2. **Auction Manipulation**: Attackers can create or modify auctions for other sellers
3. **Image Manipulation**: Attackers can upload or delete images for any product
4. **Financial Loss**: Sellers could lose control of their listings
5. **Reputation Damage**: Malicious actors could damage seller reputations
6. **Data Integrity**: Complete compromise of marketplace data integrity

## Proof of Concept

```bash
# Attack Example: Modify another seller's product
curl -X PUT https://api.bidscents.com/api/products/123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [ATTACKER_TOKEN]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sellerId": 456,  # Victim's seller ID
    "name": "Hacked Product",
    "price": 0.01
  }'
```

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enforce Authentication

All sensitive endpoints now use the `authService.requireAuth` middleware:
```typescript
app.put("/api/products/:id", authService.requireAuth, async (req, res, next) => {
  // Handler code
});
```

### 2. Use Authenticated User ID

Always use `req.user.id` from the JWT token, never trust client input:
```typescript
// SECURE: Always use authenticated user's ID
const validatedData = insertProductSchema.parse({
  ...req.body,
  sellerId: req.user.id  // Force authenticated user's ID
});
```

### 3. Verify Resource Ownership

Check ownership before allowing modifications:
```typescript
// SECURE: Verify ownership
if (product.sellerId !== req.user.id) {
  return res.status(403).json({ 
    message: "Unauthorized: You can only edit your own products",
    code: "OWNERSHIP_REQUIRED"
  });
}
```

### 4. Remove Dangerous Fallbacks

Removed all code paths that accept `sellerId` from request body/query for modification operations.

## Implementation Files

1. **`server/routes-auth-fix.ts`**: Contains all fixed endpoint implementations
2. **`server/auth-vulnerability-patch.ts`**: Detailed patch instructions
3. **`server/auth-service.ts`**: Centralized authentication service

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Required)
1. **Apply the fixes** in `auth-vulnerability-patch.ts` to `server/routes.ts`
2. **Deploy immediately** to production
3. **Audit logs** for suspicious activity
4. **Notify users** if any unauthorized modifications are detected

### Short-term (Within 1 week)
1. **Security Audit**: Review all endpoints for similar patterns
2. **Add Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of modification endpoints
3. **Implement Audit Logging**: Track all modification operations
4. **Security Testing**: Penetration testing of all API endpoints

### Long-term (Within 1 month)
1. **Security Training**: Train developers on secure coding practices
2. **Code Review Process**: Implement mandatory security reviews
3. **Automated Security Testing**: Add security tests to CI/CD pipeline
4. **Bug Bounty Program**: Consider launching to find other vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never trust client input** for authorization decisions
2. **Always use authenticated user context** from verified tokens
3. **Implement defense in depth** with multiple security layers
4. **Follow the principle of least privilege**
5. **Log and monitor** all sensitive operations

## Testing the Fixes

```bash
# Test 1: Attempt to modify another user's product (should fail)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/products/123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [USER_A_TOKEN]" \
  -d '{"sellerId": 456, "name": "Test"}'
# Expected: 403 Forbidden - "You can only edit your own products"

# Test 2: Modify own product (should succeed)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/products/123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [OWNER_TOKEN]" \
  -d '{"name": "Updated Product"}'
# Expected: 200 OK with updated product

# Test 3: Unauthenticated request (should fail)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/products/123 \
  -d '{"name": "Test"}'
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized - "Authentication required"
```

## Conclusion

These authorization vulnerabilities represent a critical security risk that could allow complete compromise of the marketplace. The fixes provided enforce proper authentication and authorization at all sensitive endpoints. Immediate deployment is recommended to protect user data and maintain platform integrity.
