# Bid Handling Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the WebSocket bid handling implementation that was added to the Bidscents MFA application based on the code found in `routes-corrupted.ts`.

## Implementation Details

### 1. WebSocket Connection Setup
- Extended WebSocket type to include `joinedAuctions` property for tracking auction room memberships
- Added connection tracking via `connectedUsers` map for user-specific notifications
- Updated authentication handler to register users in `connectedUsers` map

### 2. Auction Room Management

#### `joinAuction` Handler (Lines 337-392)
- Validates auction ID
- Creates auction rooms dynamically as needed
- Tracks room membership per connection
- Broadcasts viewer count updates to all room members
- Handles errors gracefully with informative messages

#### `leaveAuction` Handler (Lines 394-445)
- Removes users from auction rooms
- Cleans up empty rooms automatically
- Updates viewer counts for remaining users
- Handles graceful disconnection

### 3. Bid Placement Handler (`placeBid`) (Lines 447-664)

#### Authentication & Validation
- Verifies user authentication via WebSocket connection
- Falls back to database verification if needed
- Validates auction existence and status
- Ensures auction hasn't ended
- Validates minimum bid requirements

#### Database Operations
1. Resets previous winning bids using direct Supabase query
2. Creates new bid record with `isWinning: true`
3. Updates auction's current bid and bidder information
4. Fetches bidder details for display

#### Real-time Notifications
- Broadcasts new bid to all users in auction room
- Includes updated auction data in notification
- Sends confirmation to bidder
- Tracks notification count for logging

### 4. Disconnection Handling (Lines 677-717)
- Removes user from `connectedUsers` map
- Cleans up all auction room memberships
- Updates viewer counts in affected rooms
- Removes empty auction rooms

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Real-time Bid Updates**: All users viewing an auction receive instant updates when new bids are placed
2. **Room-based Broadcasting**: Efficient message delivery only to relevant users
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Rooms and connections are properly cleaned up on disconnect
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for all failure scenarios
5. **Security**: User authentication verification before bid placement
6. **Data Integrity**: Previous bids marked as non-winning before creating new winning bid

## Dependencies
- WebSocket from 'ws' package
- Supabase client for direct database operations
- Storage module for data operations
- Authentication utilities

## Testing
A test script `test-bid-websocket.js` has been created to verify the implementation:
- Tests joining auction rooms
- Tests placing bids
- Tests leaving auction rooms
- Verifies message flow

## Usage Example
```javascript
// Client-side WebSocket connection
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5000/ws');

// Join an auction
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'joinAuction',
  auctionId: '123'
}));

// Place a bid
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'placeBid',
  auctionId: '123',
  amount: '150.00'
}));

// Leave auction
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'leaveAuction',
  auctionId: '123'
}));
```

## Notes
- The implementation maintains compatibility with existing WebSocket message handlers
- All auction handlers are added to the main WebSocket message switch statement
- The `auctionRooms` and `connectedUsers` maps were already defined in the code
- Proper TypeScript types have been added for the extended WebSocket interface
