## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Expired Featured Products (⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED)
**Issue:** All 11 currently featured products have expired
**Impact:** No active featured products visible to users
**Root Cause:** Automatic expiration system is working, but no new boost purchases
**Recommendation:** 
- Create fresh test data with future expiration dates
- Implement admin tools to extend featured product duration for testing

### 2. Sort Order Inconsistency (⚠️ MINOR)
**Issue:** Featured products not always appearing first in mixed search results
**Impact:** Reduced visibility for paid featured products
**Recommendation:** Review sort logic in `products-page.tsx:144`

### 3. Error Response Codes (⚠️ MINOR)
**Issue:** Some invalid requests return 200 instead of appropriate 4xx codes
**Impact:** API consumers may not handle errors correctly
**Recommendation:** Review error handling in `routes.ts`
