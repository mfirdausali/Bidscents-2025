# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Bidscents Auction Timing Fix - Root Cause Analysis & Solution

## Issue Summary
- **Problem**: Auctions expiring 1 hour early despite recent fixes
- **Status**: CRITICAL - Affecting marketplace operations
- **Root Cause Identified**: Complex timezone handling between frontend, server, and database

## Root Cause Analysis

### Current Architecture Issues

1. **Server Timezone Mismatch**
   - Server running in JST (UTC+9) instead of UTC
   - Creates 9-hour offset in timestamp comparisons
   - Recent fixes attempted to compensate but introduced new bugs

2. **Frontend Timezone Assumptions**
   - User selects local time, but system converts to UTC
   - No clear indication to user about timezone interpretation
   - Date picker doesn't account for server timezone differences

3. **Database Storage Inconsistencies**
   - PostgreSQL stores timestamps with timezone info
   - But conversion logic between frontendâ†’serverâ†’database has gaps
   - Previous "fixes" actually made the problem worse

### The 1-Hour Discrepancy Explanation

The 1-hour early expiration (not 9-hour) suggests:
- There's a partial timezone correction happening somewhere
- Possible daylight saving time confusion
- Or an off-by-one error in timezone offset calculations

## Comprehensive Fix Implementation

### Fix #1: Server Timezone Normalization (IMMEDIATE)
