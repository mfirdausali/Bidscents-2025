# Security Update: Critical Authentication Vulnerability Fix

## Summary
A critical authentication vulnerability has been identified and fixed in this update. The vulnerability allowed users to inadvertently access other users' accounts due to improper validation in the authentication process.

## Vulnerability Details
The security issue manifested in two specific ways:
1. When viewing seller profiles, users could be automatically logged in as the seller
2. Message recipients could be automatically logged in as message senders

## Root Cause
The vulnerability was caused by an implementation flaw in the `/api/user` endpoint, which created sessions based solely on email matching without proper validation of the authentication provider ID. This meant that any user authenticated with Supabase could potentially be logged in as another user if their email matched a record in the database.

## Security Fix Implementation
The fix includes several components:

### 1. Schema Updates
- Added `providerId` field to store the authentication provider's unique user ID
- Added `provider` field to identify the authentication method used (e.g., 'supabase', 'facebook')

### 2. Authentication Flow Enhancement
- Modified the `/api/user` endpoint to require matching provider IDs for session creation
- Added secure fallback behavior that returns user data without creating a session when provider IDs don't match
- Implemented user-friendly prompts to complete authentication when needed

### 3. Registration Process Improvement 
- Updated all registration endpoints to store provider IDs for secure authentication
- Modified login endpoints to update missing provider IDs for existing users

### 4. Client-Side Updates
- Enhanced the `useAuth` hook to handle the new security response format
- Improved error handling to prevent unhandled rejections
- Added redirection to login page when additional authentication is required

### 5. Migration Script
- Created a migration script to add the new columns to the database
- Implemented automatic linking of existing users with their provider IDs

## Security Best Practices
This fix follows security best practices by:
- Implementing proper multi-factor identity validation
- Providing secure fallbacks instead of automatic access
- Maintaining backward compatibility while enhancing security
- Adding appropriate logging for security-related events

## Running the Migration
To apply the database changes for existing installations:
```
node scripts/migrate-auth-security.js
```

## Impact on Users
Existing users may be prompted to log in again once after this update is applied, but this is a one-time requirement and enhances their account security. No user data is lost during this process.
