**Note**: There's a pricing discrepancy - database shows RM 500-1000 for some packages while the boost_packages table shows much lower prices. This needs investigation.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Pricing Inconsistency üö®
- **Issue**: Actual payments show RM 100-1000 amounts while boost_packages table shows RM 5-24
- **Impact**: Potential billing/pricing errors
- **Action**: Audit pricing logic and update package definitions

### 2. High Transaction Failure Rate ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Issue**: 40% of boost purchases are failing or remaining unpaid
- **Impact**: Revenue loss and poor user experience
- **Action**: Investigate Billplz webhook reliability and payment flow

### 3. Upcoming Expiration ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Issue**: 1 product expires in 23 hours
- **Impact**: Seller may lose featured visibility without notice
- **Action**: Implement expiration notifications

### 4. Limited Current Activity ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Issue**: Only 1 currently featured product
- **Impact**: Reduced marketplace activity and revenue
- **Action**: Marketing campaign to promote boost packages

## System Health Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 24 hours)
1. **Notify seller** of product ID 221 about upcoming expiration
2. **Audit pricing system** - investigate discrepancy between database prices and actual charges
3. **Review failed payments** - check Billplz webhook integration

### Short-term Actions (Next 7 days)
1. **Implement automated expiration notifications** (24h and 1h before expiry)
2. **Create dashboard** for monitoring boost performance
3. **Fix pricing discrepancies** in boost packages
4. **Test payment flow** end-to-end

### Long-term Actions (Next 30 days)
1. **Implement cron job** to automatically unfeature expired products
2. **Add retry mechanism** for failed webhook processing
3. **Create analytics dashboard** for boost performance
4. **Consider promotional campaigns** to increase boost adoption

## Technical Recommendations

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Recommended cleanup query (run with caution)
UPDATE products 
SET is_featured = false 
WHERE featured_until < NOW() AND is_featured = true;
```

### Monitoring Setup
- Set up alerts for boost purchase failures
- Monitor featured products expiration times
- Track revenue metrics weekly
- Monitor webhook success rates

### Performance Metrics to Track
1. **Boost adoption rate** (purchases per month)
2. **Revenue per boost package**
3. **User retention** (repeat boost purchases)
4. **Payment success rate**
5. **Average time to expiration notification**

## Data Quality Issues

### Webhook Payload Analysis
- All 15 boost purchases have detailed webhook payloads
- Payment type correctly identified as "boost"
- Product details properly stored
- Boost group IDs are being generated correctly

### Missing Data Points
- No user information linked to user_id in payments table
- Boost package relationships not fully normalized
- Historical boost performance data limited

## Conclusion

The BidScents boost system is operational but requires immediate attention to:
1. Resolve pricing discrepancies
2. Improve payment success rates
3. Implement proactive expiration management
4. Enhance system monitoring

**Next Steps**: Priority should be given to fixing the pricing issues and implementing automated notifications before the current featured product expires.
